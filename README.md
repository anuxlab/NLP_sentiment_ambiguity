# Does Self-Supervised Pre-training Help *Tiny* Transformers? 
### A data-efficiency, robustness and efficiency study for CPU-only sentiment classification

Research project in NLP built around a **1.2 M-parameter-encoder BERT** (2 layers, hidden 128) that is
pre-trained *and* fine-tuned entirely on a laptop CPU. No GPU, no internet-hosted model weights required.

## Research questions
* **RQ1 (data efficiency)** – With few labels, does MLM pre-training on ~1.2 M words of *unlabeled* in-domain text beat (a) the same network trained from random init and (b) strong TF-IDF baselines?
* **RQ2 (robustness)** – How do the models cope with typos, dropped words and an out-of-domain test set (IMDb documents)?
* **RQ3 (how much pre-training?)** – How does downstream accuracy / linear-probe accuracy evolve with pre-training steps?
* **RQ4 (efficiency)** – Size, CPU latency, throughput and the effect of INT8 dynamic quantization.

slides/                  presentation
```

## Setup (Python >= 3.9)
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install tabulate                                     # only for make_assets.py markdown tables
```
CPU-only PyTorch is enough (`pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`).
Disk: < 100 MB for data + models. RAM: < 2 GB.

## Run
```bash
bash run_all.sh                 # everything (~1-1.5 h on 1 CPU core; faster with more cores)
```
or step by step:
```bash
cd src
python pretrain_mlm.py --steps 5000 --lr 1e-3 --dropout 0.0 --save_steps 0,100,300,1000,2500,5000
python run_experiments.py --stage pilot      # LR selection on dev
python run_experiments.py --stage curve      # learning curves + robustness + OOD
python run_experiments.py --stage ckpt       # pre-training-steps ablation
python efficiency.py
python make_assets.py                        # -> results/summary.md, report/figures, report/tables
```
All stages are **resumable** (finished runs are skipped via `results/results.jsonl`).
Data (SST-2 from GitHub, NLTK movie_reviews) is downloaded automatically on first use.

## Multi-domain (RQ8: cross-domain generalisation)
Two more domains, both with REAL (not proxy) ambiguity signals: Financial PhraseBank (finance news, 1,966
sentences, real annotator-agreement tiers) and Twitter Airline Sentiment (11,541 tweets, real per-tweet
confidence scores). Every run automatically reports accuracy on the OTHER two domains too (cross-domain
transfer), no extra training needed.
```bash
cd src
python run_experiments.py --stage all --domain finance    # ~15-25 min (rough estimate)
python run_experiments.py --stage all --domain airline    # ~15-25 min (rough estimate)
python backfill_cross_domain.py                            # one-off: adds cross-domain fields to old SST-2 rows
python make_assets.py                                       # fig_cross_domain, tab_cross_domain.tex, tab_amb_finance/airline.tex
```
`tiny_mlm` reuses the SAME movie-review-pretrained checkpoint on every domain (deliberately -- this tests
whether pretraining on one domain transfers to fine-tuning on another). Static embeddings (word2vec/fastText)
and TF-IDF are always trained fresh on each domain's own text. `--stage ckpt` is sst2-only (skipped for other
domains) since the pre-training-length ablation uses the movie-review checkpoint ladder specifically.

## Model families and ambiguity analysis
```bash
cd src
python run_experiments.py --stage families   # VADER, word SVM, char n-gram LR, word2vec/fastText + LR -> results/families.jsonl (~3 min)
python ambiguity.py                          # -> results/ambiguity.json (also run automatically by make_assets.py)
python make_assets.py                        # fig_families, fig_ambiguity, tab_families/tab_equiv/tab_amb_*.tex, summary.md
```
Ambiguity uses the fine-grained SST-5 test labels (downloaded automatically) as a *polarity-strength* proxy for ambiguity:
strong = very negative/very positive, weak = negative/positive (mild, close to neutral). It is not annotator disagreement.
Public checkpoints enter the ambiguity analysis when their predictions exist:
`python hf_benchmark.py --models tiny,distilbert --rerun` (re-runs earlier models and stores predictions).

## Public pre-trained checkpoints (BERT-Tiny/Mini/Small/Medium, DistilBERT, MiniLM)
Needs internet access to huggingface.co the first time (weights are cached afterwards).
```bash
cd src
python hf_benchmark.py --list                                  # model zoo with default learning rates
python hf_benchmark.py --models mini,small,minilm              # default sizes 1000,6920 x seeds 0,1,2
python hf_benchmark.py --models small --sizes 1000 --seeds 0   # cheap first check
python hf_benchmark.py --models mini,small --tune              # choose lr on dev (3 values) before the runs
python hf_benchmark.py --models /path/to/local/checkpoint      # any HF-format directory
python make_assets.py                                          # updates tab_hf*.tex, fig_hf, summary.md
```
Results go to `results/hf_results.jsonl`, `results/hf_efficiency.jsonl` and `results/preds/hf_*.npy` (stored predictions enable paired
bootstrap tests against TF-IDF). The script is **resumable**. Cost warning: DistilBERT-sized models need ~15-28 min per run on a laptop CPU.

## Build the report
Upload the whole `report/` folder to Overleaf (New Project -> Upload Project), compile `main.tex`
with pdfLaTeX + BibTeX (references are in `refs.bib`; Overleaf runs BibTeX automatically). Re-run `make_assets.py` to refresh figures/tables automatically after new experiments.

## Troubleshooting
* **`zsh: /usr/local/bin/pip: bad interpreter ... Python 2.7`** - a stale `pip` script points to a removed Python. Use `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt tabulate` (ideally inside a venv).
* **`ERROR:root:code for hash blake2b/blake2s was not found` + traceback** - printed by Python's `hashlib` at import time: your Python build lacks the
  blake2 hash functions (typically a partial pyenv build, e.g. missing OpenSSL headers when it was compiled). Nothing in this project uses blake2;
  every result in this repo was produced with these messages present, so they are safe to ignore. To remove them: `brew install openssl@3 xz`, then
  `pyenv install --force 3.13.0` (or use 3.12) and recreate the venv.
* **`Token indices sequence length is longer than ... (601 > 512)`** - harmless: whole reviews are tokenised before being cut into 62-token blocks; the long sequences are never fed to the model.
* **`Loading weights ...` / `Writing model shards ...` progress bars, qnnpack `reduce_range` warning, torch.ao deprecation notice** - informational.
* **`RuntimeError: ... NoQEngine` from `efficiency.py`** - the quantization backend must be selected explicitly; `efficiency.py` now picks fbgemm/x86/onednn/qnnpack
  (qnnpack worked on Apple Silicon) and skips the INT8 row if none is usable. INT8 speed depends on the backend: on Apple Silicon (qnnpack) it was *slower* than FP32 here.
* **Runs are "skipped"** - runs are resumable via `results/results.jsonl`. `bash run_all.sh` starts *clean*; use `--resume` to keep earlier results.
  Never mix a `results.jsonl` from one machine with checkpoints from another. `run_all.sh` does not delete `results/hf_results.jsonl`.
* **`make_assets.py` says results.jsonl not found** - run `bash run_all.sh` first (or pass `--results_dir <folder>`).
* **Numbers differ slightly on your machine** - different hardware/BLAS gives different random streams; expect changes of a fraction of a point.
  The report, slides and `results/` in this archive were all produced on one Apple-Silicon Mac.
